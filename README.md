# React-app

Blog website I built with React while learning it for the first time.

## How to run

After doing `npm install` in the root directory run:
- `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000`
  - this will create a demo REST api for fetching sample data for the front page blog posts (sample data is in `data/db.json`)
- followed by `npm start`
  - this starts a live server at `localhost:3000`
